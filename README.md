# EasyCoreData
It is often consider Core Data as difficult choice  while we need persistence storage for iOS application because the learning curve involve in core data is large. But, Core Data is the best one to use for non-trivial data storage. It can reduce the memory overhead of your app, increase responsiveness, and save you from writing a lot of boilerplate code. One thing developers need to know about the Core Data is "Core Data is not Database" meaning  Core Data uses  SQLite database as the  default persistent store on iPhone, Core Data is not a relational database. It is actually a framework that lets developers store (or retrieve) data in database in an object-oriented way.

Here with CoreDataHandler one can use CoreData without knowing deep about it and start a CoreData based project in no time. This wrapper include

1. Create Record
2. Read Record
3. Update Record
4. Remove Record
5. Remove all Record
6. Support light weight migration.
